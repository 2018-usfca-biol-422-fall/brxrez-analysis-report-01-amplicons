Abstract = {Bacteria from the phylum Deinococcus–Thermus are known for their resistance to extreme stresses including radiation, oxidation, desiccation and high temperature. Cultured Deinococcus–Thermus bacteria are usually red or yellow pigmented because of their ability to synthesize carotenoids. Unique carotenoids found in these bacteria include deinoxanthin from Deinococcus radiodurans and thermozeaxanthins from Thermus thermophilus. Investigations of carotenogenesis will help to understand cellular stress resistance of Deinococcus–Thermus bacteria. Here, we discuss the recent progress toward identifying carotenoids, carotenoid biosynthetic enzymes and pathways in some species of Deinococcus–Thermus extremophiles. In addition, we also discuss the roles of carotenoids in these extreme bacteria.},

Abstract = {Lysine cannot be synthesized by mammals and, as a consequence, is an indispensable amino acid. The main role of lysine is to participate in protein synthesis. The catabolism of lysine is principally located in the liver. Lysine released from digested protein undergoes a significant first-pass metabolism of approximately 30 to 42% in humans and piglets. An important question regarding the biological basis of the requirement of lysine is the possible participation of microbial de novo synthesized amino acids in the whole-body fluxes. Recent intake recommendations to meet the lysine requirement range from 64 to 30 mg/(kg.d) for 0.5-y infants and adults (>18 y), respectively. Lysine intake in the Western human diet is in the range 40-180 mg/(kg.d). An upper limit of 300-400 mg/(kg.d) can be considered in humans.},

Abstract = {The phylum “Deinococcus-Thermus” contains two heavily researched groups of extremophilic bacteria: the highly radioresistant order Deinococcales and the thermophilic order Thermales. Very few characteristics are known that are uniquely shared by members of the phylum “Deinococcus-Thermus”. Comprehensive phylogenetic and comparative analyses of >65 “Deinococcus-Thermus” genomes reported here have identified numerous molecular signatures in the forms of conserved signature insertions/deletions (CSIs) and conserved signature proteins (CSPs), which provide distinguishing characteristics of the phylum “Deinococcus-Thermus” and its main groups. We have identified 58 unique CSIs and 155 unique CSPs that delineate different phylogenetic groups within the phylum. Of these identified traits, 24 CSIs and 29 CSPs are characteristic of the phylum “Deinococcus-Thermus” and they provide novel and reliable means to circumscribe/describe this phylum. An additional 3 CSIs and 3 CSPs are characteristic },

Abstract = {Thermus thermophilus biosynthesizes lysine through the α-aminoadipate (AAA) pathway: this observation was the first discovery of lysine biosynthesis through the AAA pathway in archaea and bacteria. Genes homologous to the T. thermophilus lysine biosynthetic genes are widely distributed in bacteria of the Deinococcus-Thermus phylum. Our phylogenetic analyses strongly suggest that a common ancestor of the Deinococcus-Thermus phylum had the ancestral genes for bacterial lysine biosynthesis through the AAA pathway. In addition, our findings suggest that the ancestor lacked genes for lysine biosynthesis through the diaminopimelate (DAP) pathway. Interestingly, Deinococcus proteolyticus does not have the genes for lysine biosynthesis through the AAA pathway but does have the genes for lysine biosynthesis through the DAP pathway. Phylogenetic analyses of D. proteolyticus lysine biosynthetic genes showed that the key gene cluster for the DAP pathway was transferred horizontally from a phyloge},

Abstract = {In the Medical and Health Centre of the University of Debrecen, we examined the changes in the free amino acid content of the blood serum of control and experimental individuals after consumption of 2,000 mg of lysine-laden biscuits. We baked the biscuits at 130 °C, during which the greater part (70–75%) of the lysine was not converted into Maillard reaction products. After 30–60 minutes of consumption of the biscuits, the free lysine content of the blood serum increased significantly in the experimental and control group with 41–46%, and even after three hours of consumption the level was 20% higher than in the initial concentration. The free arginine content of the blood serum did not change after the consumption of control and lysine biscuits neither in the control nor in the experimental group. Therefore, the free lysine/free arginine ratio of the individuals consuming lysine increased significantly compared to the initial and the control group’s value. The antioxidant level of th},
